# myequivalents, a cross-reference service

myequivalents is a system to manage cross-references between entities that can be identified by pairs composed of a service name (e.g., EBI's ArrayExpress, Wikipedia) and an accession (e.g., E-MEXP-2514, Barack_Obama). For those familiar with the Semantic Web, we plan to support identification of entities via URIs and the owl:sameAs property.

Please have a look at the [wiki](https://github.com/EBIBioSamples/myequivalents/wiki) for details.
