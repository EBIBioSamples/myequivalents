		The managers package contains the facades that are supposed to be used to access the myequivalents infrastructure. 
		For instance, the EntityMappingManager is able to tell the cross-references associated to one or more entities.
		The managers are designed to be used in different contexts, such as web services, line commands, programmatic access.
  </p>
  
  <p>
		Due to this purpose, the manages comes as Java interfaces + different implementations, that are served to a particular
		client by the manager factory. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
		<strong>TODO</strong>: for the moment only the EntityMappingManager is arranged this way (and without the factory as
		yet). We will migrate all the managers to the architecture described here in the short future.
